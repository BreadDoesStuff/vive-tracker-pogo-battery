Insert the brass threads into the case, 1 for the tracker screw at the bottom of the case and 4 at the top of the case.

Insert a small U-shaped length of copper wire into the top lid holes to be used as contacts. If it doesn't fit, heat up some steel wire or copper wire to space out the hole.

## Securing the Components

Hot glue the switch and charging module in place. Batteries will be secured with VHB tape adhered to the bottom of the case.
